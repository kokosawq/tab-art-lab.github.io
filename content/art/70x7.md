Inspired by Jesus' words on forgiveness, this work celebrates Christ's call to forgive "up to seventy times seven" (Matthew 18:22).

<!--more-->

Matthew 18:21-22 records a conversation between Peter and Jesus:

> Then Peter came and said to Him, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Up to seven times?" Jesus said to him, "I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven."

This work shows Peter's original suggestion of forgiving up to seven times in the top row and a visual depiction of Jesus's response in the subsequent rows.
