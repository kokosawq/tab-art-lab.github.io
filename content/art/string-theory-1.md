A fractal representation of a simple pattern.

<!--more-->

In this work, I'm capturing one of the fascinating patterns which emerges when a fractal is created from a simple pattern. In this case, the pattern is based on the [n-queens problem](/tags/n-queens-problem) and we create a [Mandelbrot fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) from it.
